different dancs and fell victim to interlopers glances lost the game of chance what are the chances soon theyll go home to their husbands smug cause they know they can trust him then feverishly calling their cousins guess who we ran into at the shops walking in circles like she was lost didnt you hear they called it all off one gasp and then how did it end say it once again with feeling how

me something awful like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy when i picture my hometown theres a bronze spraytanned statue of you and a plaque underneath it that threatens to push me down the stairs at our school and it was always the same searing pain but i dreamed that one day i could say all that time you were throwin punches i was buildin somethin and i cant forgive the way you made me feel screamed fuck you aimee to the night sky as the blood was gushin but i cant forget the way you made me heal and it wasnt a fair fight or a clean kill each time that aimee stompd across my grave and then she wrot headlines in the local paper laughing at each baby step id take and it was always the same searing pain but i prayed that one day i could say all that time you were throwin punches i was buildin somethin and i couldnt wait to show you it was real screamed fuck you aimee to the night sky as the blood was gushin but i cant forget the way you made me heal everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman but she used to say she wished that you were dead i pushed each boulder up the hill your words are still just ringin in my head ringin in my head i wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool i built a legacy that you cant undo but when i count the scars theres a moment of truth that there wouldnt be this if there hadnt been you and maybe youve reframed it and in your mind you never beat my spirit black and blue i dont think youve changed much and so i changed your name and any real defining clues and one day your kid comes home singin a song that only us two is gonna know is about you cause all that time you were throwin punches it was all for nothin and our town it looks so small from way up here screamed thank you aimee to the night sky and the stars are stunnin cause i cant forget the way you made me heal everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman but she used to say she wished that you were dead so i pushed each boulder up that hill your words were still just ringin in my head ringin in my head thank you aimee thank you aimee i had died the tiniest death i spied the catch in your breath out out out out out out northbound i got carried away as you boarded your train south south south south south south a feather taken by the wind blowing im afflicted by the not knowing so i look in peoples windows transfixed by rose golden glows they have their friends over to drink nice wine i look in peoples windows in case youre at their table what if your eyes looked up and met mine one more time you had stopped and tiltd your head i still ponder what it meant now now now now now now i trid searching faces on streets what are the chances youd be downtown downtown downtown does it feel alright to not know me im addicted to the if only so i look in peoples windows like im some deranged weirdo i attend christmas parties from outside i look in peoples windows in case youre at their table what if your eyes looked up and met mine one more time two one two three four hand on the throttle thought i caught lightning in a bottle oh but its gone again and it was written i got cursed like eve got bitten oh was it punishment pad around when i get home i guess a lesser woman wouldve lost hope a greater woman wouldnt beg but i looked to the sky and said please ive been on my knees change the prophecy dont want money just someone who wants my company let it once be me who do i have to speak to about if they can redo the prophcy cards on the table mine play out lik fools in a fable oh it was sinking in sinking in oh slow is the quicksand poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand oh still i dream of him please ive been on my knees change the prophecy dont want money just someone who wants my company let it once be me who do i have to speak to about if they can redo the prophecy and i sound like an infant feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen a greater woman stays cool but i howl like a wolf at the moon and i look unstable gathered with a coven round a sorceress table a greater woman has faith but even statues crumble if theyre made to wait im so afraid i sealed my fate no sign of soulmates im just a paperweight in shades of greige spending my last coin so someone will tell me itll be okay ooh ooh ooh ooh please ive been on my knees change the prophecy dont want money just someone who wants my company let it once be me who do i have to speak to about if they can redo the prophecy who do i have to speak to to change the prophecy hand on the throttle thought i caught lightning in a bottle oh but its gone again pad around when i get home i guess a lesser woman wouldve lost hope a greater woman wouldnt beg but i looked to the sky and said please i was in my new house placing

water and i can confirm she made a curious child ever reviled by everyone except her own father with a quite bewitching face splendidly selfish charmingly helpless excellent fun til you get to know her then she runs like its a race behind her back her best mates laughed and they nicknamed her the bolter started with a kiss oh we must stop meeting like this but it always ends up with a town car speeding out the drive one evening ended with the slam of a door then hell call her a whore wish he wouldnt be sore but as she was leaving it felt like breathing all her fuckin lives flashed before her eyes it feels like the time she fell through the ice then came out alive he was a cad wanted her bad just like any good trophy hunter and she liked the way it tastes taming a bear making him care watching him jump then pulling him under and at first blush this is fate when its all roses portrait poses central park lake in tiny rowboats what a charming saturday thats when she sees the littlest leaks down in the floorboards and she just knows she must bolt started with a kiss oh we must stop meeting like this but it always ends up with a town car speeding out the drive one evening ended with the slam of a door then hell call her a whore wish he wouldnt be sore but as she was leaving it felt like breathing all her fuckin lives flashed before her eyes ahahah it feels like the time she fell through the ice then came out alive shes been many places with men of many faces first theyre off to the races and shes laughing drawin aces but none of it is changin that the chariot is waitin hearts are hers for the breakin theres escape in escaping started with a kiss oh we must stop meeting like this but it always ends up with a town car speeding out the drive one evening ended with the slam of a door but shes got the best stories you can be sure that as she was leaving it felt like freedom all her fuckin lives flashed before her eyes and she realized it feels like the time she fell through the ice then came out alive long may you reign youre an animal you are bloodthirsty out window panes talking utter nonsense you have no idea strings tied to levers sloweddown clocks tethered all this showmanship to keep it for you in sweetness way to go tiger higher and higher wilder and lighter for you long may you roar at your dinosaurs youre a just ruler covered in mud you look ridiculous and you have no idea buried down deep and out of your reach the secret we all vowed to keep it from you in sweetness way to go tiger higher and higher wilder and lighter for you you got the dragonflies above your bed you have a favorite spot on the swing set you have no room in your dreams for regrets you have no idea the time will arrive for the cruel and the mean youll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline but now well curtail your curiosity in sweetness way to go tiger way to go tiger higher and higher higher and higher wilder and lighter for you now and then she rereads the manuscript of the entire torrid affair they compared their licenses he said im not a donor but id give you my heart if you needed it she rolled her eyes and said youre a professional he said no just a good samaritan he said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was soon theyd be pushin strollers but soon it was over in the age of him she wished she was thirty and made coffee every morning in a frnch press afterwards she only at kids cereal and couldnt sleep unless it was in her mothers bed then she dated boys who were her own age with dart boards on the backs of their doors she thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years everything had been above board she wasnt sure and the years passed like scenes of a show the professor said to write what you know lookin backwards might be the only way to move forward then the actors were hitting their marks and the slow dance was alight with the sparks and the tears fell in synchronicity with the score and at last she knew what the agony had been for the only thing thats left is the manuscript one last souvenir from my trip to your shores now and then i reread the manuscript but the story isnt mine anymore
